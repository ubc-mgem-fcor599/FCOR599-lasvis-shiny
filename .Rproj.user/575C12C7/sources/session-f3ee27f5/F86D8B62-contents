## [Point Cloud Visualization]{.underline}

### Rotating Point Clouds with lidR

![Example of a GIF you can produce! (Please don't use this exact one for submission)](images/example_gif.gif){fig-align="center" width="500"}

[**Download the Rotating LAS GIF Script and sample data (.zip)**](content/rotating_las_gif.zip)

**Contains:**

rotating_gif.R - an R script containing the rotating GIF from las/laz function

rotating_las_gif.Rproj - an R project file, use this to ensure the example paths work\
las_ex\\ - folder containing five example 400m2 plots of [drone lidar](https://enterprise.dji.com/zenmuse-l2 "Data collected using the DJI L2 in central British Columbia") data to play with

**Instructions:**

1.  Download and extract contents to a folder
2.  Open the rotating_las_gif R Project using RStudio
3.  Open rotating_gif.R in RStudio, run the script to generate your first gif
4.  Play around with different options until you're happy with your gif

### Potree

## [Shiny Apps]{.underline}

### **The TreeDetectoR Shiny App**

![Tree detection in a Shiny app, try it yourself below!](images/itd_shiny.png){alt="Tree detection in a Shiny app, try it yourself below!" fig-align="center"}

[**Download the ITD example ShinyApp (.zip)**](content/itd_shiny.zip)

**Contains:**

itd_shiny.R - an R script containing the tree detection Shiny App components

itd_shiny.Rproj - an R project file, use this to ensure the example paths work\
data/chm_ext - four example 0.25 m Canopy Height Models (CHM)

**Instructions:**

1.  Download and extract contents to a folder
2.  Open the itd_shiny R Project using RStudio
3.  Open itd_shiny.R in RStudio and run entire script to initate the shiny app
4.  Load an example CHM (or your own) and play around

### **More resources**

-   [Getting started with shinyapps.io (web hosting)](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/share/shinyapps/)

-   Read the Shiny textbook, there is no better resource.

![Mastering Shiny - Free textbook by Hadley Wickham](images/textbook.jpg){alt="Mastering Shiny - Free textbook by Hadley Wickham" fig-align="center" width="250"}

## Deliverables

-   Take three PNG screenshots of tree detection results from the ITD shiny app

    -   Try out different window sizes, visualization options etc

-   Take a screenshot of your favourite [Potree example](https://github.com/potree/potree?tab=readme-ov-file#examples) point cloud, write two sentences about why you found it interesting or "cool".

<!-- -->

-   Create your own rotating GIF from a point cloud

    -   Make sure this is less than 50mb in size

    -   Feel free to just use the example laz files provided
